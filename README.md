# django-breadcrumbs3

A small app to provide ready-to-go breadcrumb support in Django by removing
the generation of breadcrumbs out of the templates.

It is known to work with:

* Python 2.7+, 3.3+, 3.4+
* Django 1.7+, 1.8+

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sjkingo/django-breadcrumbs3.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/sjkingo/django-breadcrumbs3)

## Installation

1. `$ pip install django-breadcrumbs3`
2. Add `breadcrumbs3` to your `INSTALLED_APPS` setting (this is to provide access to the template tag).
3. Make sure `django.template.context_processors.request` is present in your
   `TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS` (pre-Django 1.8) or `TEMPLATES.OPTIONS.context_processors` (1.8+) setting.
4. Add `breadcrumbs3.middleware.BreadcrumbMiddleware` to `MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES`.

## Testing

You can run the tests through Django's test runner:

```
$ python manage.py test breadcrumbs3
```

## Using breadcrumbs3

There are two parts to generating breadcrumbs: adding each *crumb* in your
view, and rendering the breadcrumb list in a template.

An example view might be:

```python
def some_view(request):
    request.breadcrumbs('Some view title', request.path_info)
    ...
```

There are a few options for calling the `request.breadcrumbs` method:

* The first argument is always required and specifies the title.
* The second argument is optional, and if given is a URL to link
  this crumb to. You may like to use [`reverse`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/urlresolvers/#reverse) so
  you don't have to hardcode any URLs.
* If the second argument is None, no link will be provided for this crumb.

You can then render the breadcrumbs using the `breadcrumbs` template tag:

`templates/some_template.html`:

```html
{% load breadcrumbs %}

<div class="breadcrumbs">
    {% breadcrumbs %}
</div>
```

Breadcrumbs are rendered as a list like so:

```html
<ul class="breadcrumbs-list">
    <li class="breadcrumb">...</li>
    ...
</ul>
```
